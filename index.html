            <h1>ZOMBIE ESCAPE</h1>
            <p id="story">TIt started as a whisper—news reports of a strange flu spreading in a remote city. No one took it seriously. People still went to work, kids still played in the streets, and life continued as usual. But then the flu turned into something else.

                Patients in hospitals began to change. Their skin grew pale, their veins darkened, and their eyes turned a sickly yellow. They became violent, attacking doctors, nurses—anyone in sight. The first bite victims were rushed to emergency rooms, but within hours, they too turned into mindless creatures, driven by an insatiable hunger for flesh.
                
                The virus spread like wildfire. Airports shut down, streets became warzones, and emergency broadcasts urged people to stay indoors. But it was too late. One bite, just a scratch, and a person had only hours before the infection took hold. Families turned on each other. Cities fell overnight.
                
                Now, the world is on the brink of collapse. Survivors scavenge for food, avoiding the infected that lurk in the shadows. Governments have collapsed, and the military is losing ground. The only rule left? Don’t get bitten.
                
                Because once you do, there’s no coming back.</p>
            <P id='story'>The game is happening in 4 arenas you can have chose on which arena to play ONCE ARENA IS CHOSEN THERE WILL BE NO COME BACK...................</P>
